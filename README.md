# Fuel-Consumption-DA
The data table provided contains information about the fuel consumption and emissions of various car models in the past 5 yers

**DESCRIPTION**
The data table provided contains information about the fuel consumption and emissions of various car models in the year 2000. The table includes details such as the make, model, vehicle class, engine size, cylinders, transmission, fuel type, and fuel consumption in both highway and combined settings. The fuel consumption is given in liters per 100 kilometers, and the combined fuel consumption is also provided in miles per gallon. Finally, the table includes the emissions of each vehicle in grams per kilometer. The car models belong to popular brands such as Acura and Audi and are categorized based on their vehicle class, including compact, mid-size, and subcompact cars, as well as station wagons.

**Introduction:**
This dataset contains information about the fuel consumption and emissions of various car models in the year 2000. The data is organized in a tabular form with columns containing details such as the make, model, vehicle class, engine size, cylinders, transmission, fuel type, and fuel consumption in both highway and combined settings. The fuel consumption is given in liters per 100 kilometers, and the combined fuel consumption is also provided in miles per gallon. Finally, the table includes the emissions of each vehicle in grams per kilometer.

**Dataset Information:**
The dataset includes the following columns:

Year: the year the car model was produced (all values in the dataset are 2000)
Make: the make of the car model
Model: the model name of the car
Vehicle Class: the class of the car (e.g., subcompact, compact, mid-size, station wagon)
Engine Size: the size of the engine in liters
Cylinders: the number of cylinders in the engine
Transmission: the type of transmission (A4, AS5, M5, M6)
Fuel: the type of fuel used by the car (X - regular gasoline, Z - premium gasoline)
Fuel Consumption in City (L/100 km): the fuel consumption in liters per 100 kilometers while driving in the city
Fuel Consumption on Highway (L/100 km): the fuel consumption in liters per 100 kilometers while driving on the highway
Fuel Consumption Combined (L/100 km): the combined fuel consumption in liters per 100 kilometers while driving in both city and highway conditions
Fuel Consumption Combined (mpg): the combined fuel consumption in miles per gallon while driving in both city and highway conditions
Emissions: the amount of CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer
